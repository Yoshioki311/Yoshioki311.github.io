							<strong>University Courses</strong>
						</h2>
						<h3>
							<u>First Year</u>
						</h3>
						<p>
							<strong>APS110</strong> - Engineering Chemistry and Materials Science
						</p>
						<p>
							This course is structured around the principle of the structure-property relationship. 
							This relationship refers to an understanding of the microstructure of a solid, that is, 
							the nature of the bonds between atoms and the spatial arrangement of atoms, which permits 
							the explanation of observed behaviour. Observed materials behaviour includes mechanical, 
							electrical, magnetic, optical, and corrosive behaviour. Topics covered in this course 
							include: structure of the atom, models of the atom, electronic configuration, the 
							electromagnetic spectrum, band theory, atomic bonding, optical transparency of solids, 
							magnetic properties, molecular bonding, hybridized orbitals, crystal systems, 
							lattices and structures, crystallographic notation, imperfections in solids, reaction 
							rates, activation energy, solid-state diffusion, materials thermodynamics, free energy, 
							and phase equilibrium.
						</p>
						<br class="clearfix" />
						<p>
							<strong>APS111</strong> - Engineering Strategies & Practice I
						</p>
						<p>
							This course introduces and provides a framework for the design process. Students are 
							introduced to communication as an integral component of engineering practice. The course 
							is a vehicle for understanding problem solving and developing communications skills. This 
							first course in the two Engineering Strategies and Practice course sequence introduces 
							students to the process of engineering design, to strategies for successful team work, 
							and to design for human factors, society and the environment. Students write team and 
							individual technical reports and give presentations within a discussion group.
						</p>
						<br class="clearfix" />
						<p>
							<strong>CIV100</strong> - Mechanics
						</p>
						<p>
							The principles of statics are applied to composition and resolution of forces, moments 
							and couples. The equilibrium states of structures are examined. Throughout, the free body 
							diagram concept is emphasized. Vector algebra is used where it is most useful, and stress 
							blocks are introduced. Shear force diagrams, bending moment diagrams and stress-strain 
							relationships for materials are discussed. Stress and deformation in axially loaded members 
							and flexural members (beams) are also covered.
						</p>

						<h3>
							<u>Second Year</u>
						</h3>
						<p>
							<strong>ECE212</strong> - Circuit Analysis
						</p>
						<p>
							Nodal and loop analysis and network theorems. Natural and forced response of RL, RC, and RLC 
							circuits. Sinusoidal steady-state analysis. Frequency response; resonance phenomena; poles and 
							zeros; applications of the Laplace transform.
						</p>
						<br class="clearfix" />
						<p>
							<strong>ECE216</strong> - Signals and Systems
						</p>
						<p>
							Fundamental discrete- and continuous-time signals, definition and properties of systems, 
							linearity and time invariance, convolution, impulse response, differential and difference 
							equations, Fourier analysis, sampling and aliasing, applications in communications.
						</p>
						<br class="clearfix" />
						<h3>
							<u>Third Year</u>
						</h3>
						<p>
							<strong>ECE320</strong> - Fields and Waves
						</p>
						<p>
							Voltage and current waves on a general transmission line, reflections from the load and source, 
							transients on the line, and Smith’s chart. Maxwell’s equations, electric and magnetic fields 
							wave equations, boundary conditions, plane wave propagation, reflection and transmission at 
							boundaries, constitutive relations, dispersion, polarization; Poynting vector; waveguides. 
						</p>
						<br class="clearfix" />
						<p>
							<strong>ECE344</strong> - Operating Systems
						</p>
						<p>
							Operating system structures, concurrency, synchronization, deadlock, CPU scheduling, memory 
							management, file systems. The laboratory exercises will require implementation of part of an 
							operating system.
